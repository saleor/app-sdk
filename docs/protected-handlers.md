# Protected API handlers

The App SDK provides helpers which ensure, that incoming requests are sent from Saleor dashboard.
Example of such situation could be a change of the application configuration iframe.

> **Warning**
> This handler only works for requests originated from frontend calls. It checks JWT token from the client, which is available
> in AppBridge. Do not call this endpoint from backend context (calling it from API function will fail)

## How to protect the endpoint

First, create handler for your business logic. The only difference from usual NextJS handler is an additional argument `ctx` of type `ProtectedHandlerContext`, which contains additional data related to the request:

```typescript
export type ProtectedHandlerContext = {
  baseUrl: string; // the URL your application is available
  authData: AuthData; // Auth Data which can be used to communicate with the Saleor API
  user: {
    email: string;
    userPermissions: string[];
  };
};
```

`createProtectedHandler` will check if:

- the request has `saleor-api-url` header of the Saleor instance
- the API URL has been registered, with help of the APL
- the request has `authorization-bearer`
- the auth token is a valid JWT token created by the Saleor running on the given URL
- user has required permissions in the token

For example purposes our endpoint will only log welcome message:

```typescript
import { createProtectedHandler, ProtectedHandlerContext } from "@saleor/app-sdk/handlers/next";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { saleorApp } from "../../../saleor-app";

export const handler = async (
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse,
  ctx: ProtectedHandlerContext
) => {
  console.log(`Greetings from ${ctx.authData.domain}`);
  res.status(200);
};

/**
 * If any of the requirements is failed, an error response will be returned.
 * Otherwise, provided handler function fill be called.
 *
 * Last argument is optional array of permissions that will be checked. If user doesn't have them, will return 401 before handler is called
 */
export default createProtectedHandler(handler, saleorApp.apl, ["MANAGE_ORDERS"]);
```

To make your requests successfully communicate with the backend, `saleor-api-url` and `authorization-bearer` headers are required:

```typescript
fetch("/api/protected", {
  headers: {
    /**
     * Both API URL and token are available in the appBridgeState. Based on those
     * headers the backend will check if the request has enough permissions to
     * perform the action.
     */
    "saleor-api-url": saleorApiUrl,
    "authorization-bearer": token,
  },
});
```

If you want to read more about `appBridgeState`, check [App Bridge](./app-bridge.md) documentation.

### Using `useAuthenticatedFetch()` hook

Instead of manually attaching headers with AppBridge context, you can use `useAuthenticatedFetch()` hook

Since it requires AppBridge, it's only available in browser context. It depends on `Window` object,
so your app will break if Next.js tries to render it server-side. Hence, ensure component that uses the hook is imported with dynamic()

Component must be within `AppBridgeProvider` to have access to the AppBridge

```tsx
import { useAuthenticatedFetch } from "@saleor/app-sdk/app-bridge";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export const ClientComponent = () => {
  const fetch = useAuthenticatedFetch();

  useEffect(() => {
    /**
     * Auth headers are set up automatically, so you can just call the fetch function
     */
    fetch("/api/protected");
  }, [fetch]);

  return <div>Your UI</div>;
};
```
