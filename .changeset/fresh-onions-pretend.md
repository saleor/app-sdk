Updated project license: it previously used BSD 3-Clause for code and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for artwork.
Since this project doesn't include any artwork, Creative Commons license was removed.

Updated `license` field in `package.json`: It incorrectly stated `ISC` license instead of `BSD-3-Clause`.
